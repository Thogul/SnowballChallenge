            <p>Have you ever worried about third parties listening in on your conversations through 
                your lap-top or cellphone microphone? MicBlock will instantly alleviate your concerns 
                simply with the flick of a switch. With this brand-new innovative technology at your 
                disposal, you will no longer be a target for businesses or hackers that want to 
                gather information about you through your microphone. MicBlock is an acoustic scrambler 
                no bigger than your fingernail that fits over your lap-top microphone. Sounds from 
                your surroundings enter MicBlock and bounces around the myriad tiny canals inside. 
                The layout of canals and empty space inside MicBlock might at first resemble the 
                canals of the inner ear, however the canals of MicBlock are designed specifically to 
                scatter sound in such a way to make even the clearest, crispest speech unintelligible. 
                If you would like to have the use of your microphone again it`s as simple as sliding 
                MicBlock to the side to uncover your still perfectly intact and functional microphone.
