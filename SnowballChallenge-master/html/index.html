            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>A growing number of smartphone users are reporting seeing advertisements that seem to have 
                been adapted, not only to previous searches, but also things they have only spoken about 
                in the immediate vicinities of their smartphone. This is a major perceived issue. Nobody 
                likes to even think that someone might be listening in on their most intimate conversations, 
                let alone using that information to sell you things. We see this uneasiness in the 
                common practice of people taping over their webcams. But why should people protect themselves 
                from hacking and unwanted data gathering only by blocking their camera? Surely having 
                your microphone hacked may be even more damaging. We aim to keep our product's users safe 
                from hackers and any other unwanted audio recording. With time hackers will get more 
                advanced and subsequently the problem of unwanted audio recording will need an innovative 
                solution.
